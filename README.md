# Rooted in Darkness
** Roguelike game inspired by Vampire Survivors **

The main objective of this game is to escape from a contaminated forest where the player is trapped. 
In order to escape, he must destroy the four contamination points and defeat the source of the 
contamination. Enemies appear in hordes, rising from the ground, and the more time passes, the more 
enemies appear, making the game progressively more challenging. The player gains experience by 
eliminating enemies, which allows him to unlock new skills or improve skills already acquired.
